        <div class="text pb-5 text-white-50">We aim to provide all of our customers with an excellent experience at
          Orion
          Computers. Regardless of the need or wants of the customer,
          we fulfill it to the best of our ability! This service changes the playing field! Led by a specialised team of
          computer mechanics, we perform a internal and
          external system refresh while still retaining your looks and data, but with better performance!</div>

        <div class="htext pt-2">Service</div>
        <div class="text pb-5 text-white-50">To provide our customers with a better understanding of this service, we
          have provided a step by step guide on the process
          <br><br>
          Step 1: You will have to walk in at our Office (Address is located in the Contacts page). Having the
          components is optional. If you are looking to build a new PC
          but do not have the components, an agent will be assigned to you to assist you further.
          <br><br>
          Step 2: Our representative will allocate you the next available timeslot for the Custom Assembly Service. If
          you decide to go forth with the service, the process for
          the assembly will take about 1 business day or less, from the allocated timeslot given to you.
          <br><br>
          Step 3: An SMS will be sent to you to verify that your system is ready for collection. Drop by our office to
          make payment and pick it up!</div>
