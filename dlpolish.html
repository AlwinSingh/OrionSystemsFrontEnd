          have
          provided a step by step guide on the process
          <br><br>
          Step 1: You will have to walk in at our Office (Address is located in the Contacts page) with your Desktop or
          Laptop.
          <br><br>
          Step 2: Our representative will allocate you the next available timeslot for your Desktop / Laptop. If you
          decide
          to go forth with the service, the process for
          the internal and external cleaning will take about 1-2 business days from the allocated timeslot given to you.
