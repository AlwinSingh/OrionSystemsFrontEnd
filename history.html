        <div class="text p-3 ml-2">Orion Computers was founded in 2012 by a group of friends who
          specialisd in
          Information
          Technology. It aims to provide customers in South East Asia with reasonably priced gaming desktops and
          laptops.
          <br><br> Orion has had many failures however through commitment and perseverance, we managed to pull through
          and come up at the top. Now, Orion Computers has had 550,000 orders just from South East Asia from 2016 to
          2019.
          <br><br> Within 2012 to the end of 2015, Orion
          faced many difficulties in tapping on the South East Asian market as many had no interest or were not well off
          to afford Gaming Desktops and Laptops even though
          a great majority of South East Asian residers were very into Gaming. This caused us to struggle with business
          expenses and the hopes of expansion. <br><br>
          However with the help of MNCs such as MSI, Gigabyte, etc and our hardwork in sourcing parts for the SEA
          market,
          we managed to finally tap into the market.
          Desktops and Laptops had a price reduction of nearly 70% as the parts that we import in with the help of
          numerous proposals to MNCs, were signifcantly cheaper.
          <br><br> Today, Orion is proud to be one of the top leading custom gaming desktops and laptops companies in
          South East Asia. Service, Excellence and Friendship is key!</div>
